# Below is a list of inject_snap commands and short bit of code I've
#   found useful for setting up an observation




####### Defined Variables ########

$expname - the name of the experiment.
$sourcename - the name of your source.
$antenna - the antenna being used, Ww -> 12M, Wa -> 30M.
$freq - the center frequency of the Upper and Lower sidebands.
$ifxgain - the optimal gain for IFX.
$bandwidth - the bandwidth of the recorded bandpass, multiple of 2.
$ra - the right ascension in the correct format
$dec - the declination in the correct format




####### Antenna Setup ########


inject_snap -w ifx=1,$ifxgain,$filter
#Sets up each IF (4 possible, IFA, IFB, IFC, IFD)
#$ifxgain sets the level of gain for IFX, if $ifxgain=agc the gain is
#   automatically set so to satisfy the optimal level for the analog to digital
#   converter.
#$filter is the filter used on IFX. The possible values are:
#   2 (10-512 MHz), 1 (512-1024 MHz), 4 (1024-1536).


inject_snap -w ifx
#Queries the current ifx setup.


inject_snap log=$expname
#Changes the current log to $expname.log. This log records the output of the
#   field system and not your script.


inject_snap -w mk5b_mode=ext,0x00000f0f,$decimation
#Sets the Mark5 recording mode.
#ext selects to the external 32 MHz clock.
#The bit mask here records channels 1, 2, 5, and 6 at 2-bits.
#   The bit mask is hexadecimal so 00000f0f = 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1111 0000 1111.
#   The number of channels record must ALWAYS be a multiple of 2.
#$decimation = 32 / 2 x $bandwidth. For more info on this please
#   look at mk5decimationratio.doc.


inject_snap -w form=astro
#This command sets up the channel mapping for the DBBC. For the exact channel mapping
#   please look at DBBC2 DDC form  table v105_291214.pdf.


inject_snap -w bbcX=$freq,a,$bandwidth
#Sets the center frequency, IF input and bandwidth for each bbc (16 possible, bbc01 - bbc16)
#$freq is the center frequency between the Upper and Lower sidebands
#a selects input a in the IF, consult with Tim, Stuart, or Ben about curent input setup
#$bandwidth is the recorded bandwidth, MUST be a multiple of 2.


inject_snap -w bbcX
#Queries the current bbcX setup.




####### Antenna Control ########


inject_snap -w source=$sourcename,$ra,$dec,2000.0
#Slews the antenna to a source.
#$sourcename is just the name of the source, e.g. Orion, Vela.
#$ra is the right ascension where 08h 35m 20.65525s -> 083521.
#$dec is the declination where −45° 10′ 35.1545″ -> -451035.
#2000.0 selects the J2000 reference frame (default).


inject_snap -w source=stow
#Stows the antenna. Should always be don once observation is over.




####### Recording Control ########


inject_snap -w mk5=record=on:$name\:$expname\:$antenna
#Tells the Mark5B to start recording on the next second tick.
#$name is the name of the scan, i.e. scan1.
#$expname is the name of the experiment.
#$antenna is the current antenna, Ww -> 12M, Wa -> 30M.


inject_snap -w mk5=record=off
#stops the current recording on the next second tick.


inject_snap -w mk5=record?
#queries the current recording state.


inject_snap -w bank_check
#updates the diskpack status monitor.
